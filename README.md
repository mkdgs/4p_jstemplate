4p_jstemplate
=============

test it:
http://jsfiddle.net/mkdgs/FvBnX/

i've made this template engine, with some idea similar to handlebar, but all presentational template logic is in javascript 
(we have don't need to learn a new template language again) and it's easy to mix html and javascript, like php with html.

I submit this to your eye and your terrible judgement (for the moment it's a proof of concept)

give me a feedback  ;)
